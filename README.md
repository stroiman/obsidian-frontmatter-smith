## Use cases

I may have an idea for a pubslihed article about some aspect of JavaScript 
development. For that, I might want to have an `type: Article` property, as
well as something like `state: in-progress`, and I might want to have tags,
such as `javascript`, `software-development`, `tdd`, etc.

This plugin makes it much easier to add these types.
